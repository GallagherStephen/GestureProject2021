#### Description:
The aim of the game is to be able to play it in a variety of ways by combining different gestures and using various pieces of hardware. The game performs well by using gestures/recognition from the webcam to play the game while using speech gesture to navigate in the game while also being able to return to mouse and keyboard for anyone who wishes too. The integration of all this hardware and software makes the game's goal more exciting because it allows for several languages to be learned.
